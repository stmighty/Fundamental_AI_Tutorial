example code in this folder are from chatgpt. However, I have attach link as a reference


** only this folder that is mostly relied on chatgpt, the rest folders are mostly done by yourself

** synchronous and asynchronous programming are not opposites but rather different approaches to handling tasks.


1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4.1 done (with reference link)


1.4.2, 1.4.3 ยังไม่ได้ดูดีๆ (ไม่สำคัญมาก)
2.1.2 เหลือ queue 
2.3, 2.4 from chatgpt (still incorrect)
